In this project, I worked on a multi-objective search algorithm that allows me to develope a tour of a floor of the building for a potential robot tour guide. 
Given a map and all the locations that appears on the map, a set of locations and potential destinations with different importance, can an algorithm be developed
to generate a path that visits as many destinations as possible while guaranteeing a certain distance and time? What would be the relationship between the length of 
the tour and the number of destinations visited? If more potential destinations are given, how quickly can the algorithm run and how good are the results? 

Included in this repository are two implemented algorithms that generates a tour path on a graph representation of the floor (the tour environment), as well as files 
with code thet generates graphs to analyze the efficiency of the resulting paths.
